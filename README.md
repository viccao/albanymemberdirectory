## FIWI Staging/Prodcution Login Protection

This plugin enables prevents users not logged into WP to view sites on Staging and Production servers. The function activates by locating either the phrase 'staging' or 'production' in the url of the environment - for this reason its ok to leave on once the site launches. Keeping the plugin activated after site launch will prevent the plugin deactivating during local/staging push and pull.

If you need to add support for a domain that does not contain `staging` or `production`, add the url in the 'Server Protection' options panel.
